## Stack Overflow Is Not Your Tech Support

Eric Steven Raymond's "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" is an insightful and provocative guide on
"how to ask questions in a way more likely to get you a satisfactory answer."  Many of Mr. Raymond's suggestions can be
grouped in three categories:
- Professionalism (i.e., showing courtesy, patience, post your question to the right forum, tact, and gratitude)
- Clarity (i.e., clearly stating your problem, what you have done so far, and what you are trying to do)
- Commitment (i.e., the effort you put into solving the problem on your own, writing your question, and following-up)


## Of Professionalism

In a perfect world, all of the Mr. Raymond's points would be self-evident.  The world, however, is not perfect, and even
some of the most obvious tips are need repeating to hammer in their importance.  One of the most salient points he
nails at the beginning of his essay is that you cannot
"assume that the author of an informative web page wants to be your free consultant."  While he is speaking about
writing directly to an individual in this example, it not a stretch to apply this idea to posting on forums.
The key word here is "free" and it highlights a critical difference that threw me for a bit because I take civility and
professionalism very seriously.
 
I work at UHM School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene's Office of Student Services.  As someone who might be the school's
first contact with a new student, it is vital that I make a good impression.  Experience has taught me that there are in
fact "stupid" questions as Mr. Raymond points out.  The difference is that I cannot call someone out for asking a
question that I might have just answered or it is covered on the web site they just professed to have read.  I do
understand the impulse to give a "RTFM" or "STFW" type response.  Worse still, I occasionally have to deal with people
having a bad day, and realistically I cannot always give them the answer they want to hear.  So, for me, I often find
reading posts on tech forums a little grating.
  
Sometimes it is the person asking the question, sometimes it is the people answering the question, and then there is the
bickering between responders.  There is a lot behavior that seems "unprofessional" to me, but Mr Raymond's essay is not
about turning to a consulting companies for tech support.  He is actually talking about reaching out to a community of
volunteers whose motives and means of communications will be as varied and individuals that make up that community.  One
of the more reassuring discoveries I made while researching this essay was that Meta Stack Overflow included questions
that tackled was behavior of its members, and the community itself can take actions to help police itself.

Even though the people on Stack Exchange and other forums may not be your personal tech support and they may not always
behave in a way the way you might feel is professional that is no excuse for you to behave in an unprofessional manner.  The
section entitled "On Not Reacting Like a Loser" takes a survivalist tact with an emphasis the importance of being thick
skinned, which given some controversy in the tech world may not always be the best way to handle matter.  Still, the
the point of the essay is not about addressing the faults of hacker culture.  Instead, Mr. Raymond is focused on 
priming "newbies" to successfully interact with a community that one day they might join.  Understanding hacker culture
and what their norms are outside the work place can facilitate more successful interactions.

>The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn't, we wouldn't be here. If you give us an interesting question to chew on we'll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise. Among hackers, “Good question!” is a strong and sincere compliment.

Questions, and we all face problems that we cannot solve on our own, are a way to interact with the hacker community.
Our questions therefore not are a way to help ourselves, but to help others.  This why it is so important to make sure
that you are posting on the appropriate forum, using a good header and tags, as well as being responsive to replies.
And of course, it is vital that you update the status of you question.  Whether you are adding to the
post with new insights or even better alerting everyone that you now have the answer, so that you can:

>Help your community learn from the question. When you field a good question, ask yourself “How would the relevant documentation or FAQ have to change so that nobody has to answer this again?” Then send a patch to the document maintainer.---

Rather, it important to keep in mind that you are interacting with a community that you might one day join.

Quite appropriately, the essay ends with a section on "How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way."  All new hackers with
the fortitude to stick with it will eventually become experienced, and in time they can give back to the community by
answering questions in turn.


## Of Clarity and Commitment

As I was reading the essay, I thought about those "RTFM" and "STFW" questions, and immediately looked for something that 
seemed so simple and obvious that it also demanded such a response.  I Googled how to write for loops in Stack OverFlow,
and found: 
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4170656/for-loop-in-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4170656/for-loop-in-python),
with the following question under the header "for loop in Python" with a python tag:

>In C/C++, I can have the following loop for(int k = 1; k <= c ; k +=2)
>
>How do do the same thing in Python?
>
>I can do this for k in range(1,c): in Python, which would be identical to for(int k = 1; k <= c ; k++) in C/C++.

I happy to report that no one posted a "RTFM" or a "STFW", which I am sure crossed the minds of my many who saw the
post.  I was surprised that no one made a reference to the official Python documentation site.

On first appearance, this seems like a fairly straight forward question, but it is actually problematic for the
following 2 reasons:
- What is the goal?  Is there a goal?
- Python2 or Python3? And Other Warning Signs!


## What is the goal? Is There a goal?

One of the tips that I plan to follow from here on out is to include a description of my goal.  In this case, either the
questioner wants to know the answer for the sake of knowing the answer, or it could for some other reason.  I began to
suspect something that the essay mentioned, but I was initially skeptical about: 

>Hackers are good at spotting homework questions; most of us have done them ourselves. Those questions are for you to work out, so that you will learn from the experience. It is OK to ask for hints, but not for entire solutions.

I can easily imagine that person asking this question is a student who just learned C and C++, and now it is time to
learn Python.  Maybe I am right, maybe I am wrong, but the lack of clarity about that end game is can have
unexpected consequences.

The first responder to this post got derailed and went so far off on a tangent that they did not actually answer the
question because they assumed they knew what questioner wanted:

>You should also know that in Python, iterating over integer indices is bad style, and also slower than the alternative. If you just want to look at each of the items in a list or dict, loop directly through the list or dict.

```python
mylist = [1,2,3]
for item in mylist:
    print item

mydict  = {1:'one', 2:'two', 3:'three'}
for key in mydict:
    print key, mydict[key]
```

>This is actually faster than using the above code with range(), and removes the extraneous i variable.
>
>If you need to edit items of a list in-place, then you do need the index, but there's still a better way:

```python
for i, item in enumerate(mylist):
    mylist[i] = item**2
```

>Again, this is both faster and considered more readable. This one of the main shifts in thinking you need to make when coming from C++ to Python.

Now the first responder should have asked probably clarified what the questioner planned to do with a for loop first,
but given the nature of the Python community and how zealous they can be about doing things the "Pythonic way" it is not 
at all surprising.

The second responder to the post actually answered the question with a simple: 

```python
for k in range(1,c+1,2):
```

This of course spawned a fury of replies over the merits of the code, but at least it answered the question.  Sadly,
the author of the question was not one of the people who took part of the conversation about for loops and efficiency in
Python.  Nor did they thank the second responder, or any of the responders.
  

## Python2 or Python3?  The Warning Signs!

In this case, the difference between Python2 and Python3 is not that big of a deal given the simplicity of the code, but
the fact that question does not specify which version of Python bellies a greater problem.  How much thought and effort
did author of the question put into their post?  The typo: "How do do the same thing in Python?" is another sign of
either laziness or indifference.

Much of Mr. Raymond's tips focus on the importance of taking the time to write a good question.  Not only is a good
question important in terms of getting the best answer, but it also demonstrates the authors commitment to working
towards a solution.  As a former teacher, I can tell you that one thing that always bothered me was when a student
would say "I don't get it."  What is it that you are not getting?  Hysterics and panic are no guarantee that someone
really wants to learn as opposed to being spoon fed the answer.

The problem of course is that it takes time to formulate a good question!  You need to spend trying to solve the problem
on your own so that you have a sense of the problem and you will have include what you have done so far in your question.
You then need to think about the question, which is still part of the problem solving process as you might still be able
to solve the problem on your own as you restate the problem for someone else.  Then you need to write your question, and
of course proof read it!  As one of my professors used to say, you only write, when you re-write.

A good question must clearly and concisely communicate: 
- Context 
- Objective(s)
- What you have done so far
- What is the problem

The irony of course is that the for-loop question would not have been hard to salvage.  A better and simple way to ask
this for a pointer to a good reference or an online Python training program, and then if you were still stuck, turn to
the forum with a better question.

## A Good question!

So, what is a good question?  One technical question that I faced when I started to use Ubuntu was a problem updating
my clamav.  Thankfully, the person who made this gave it a great header name, so that finding it on Google was a breeze:

>clamav - ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process?

[https://askubuntu.com/questions/909273/clamav-error-var-log-clamav-freshclam-log-is-locked-by-another-process](https://askubuntu.com/questions/909273/clamav-error-var-log-clamav-freshclam-log-is-locked-by-another-process)

The post:

>I have installed clamav and I want to to update the files that it uses to identify viruses:

```bash
$ sudo freshclam

ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process
ERROR: Problem with internal logger (UpdateLogFile = /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log).
```

>What should I do with this error?
>
>EDIT:

```bash
$ sudo lsof /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log

COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME
freshclam 866 clamav    3wW  REG  259,1   100134 10486045 /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
```

What I love about this question is that it is well named, it objective is clear, the problem is clear, and the error
message is clear.  It is posted on the right on the Stack Exchange forum, with good tags:  malware, antivirus, clamav.
The person who posed the even responded to a question in a reply and added the "EDIT:" section the
post showing responsiveness.


## “Make it clear you appreciate the time people spend helping you for free.”

Of course, my favorite part of Mr. Raymond's essay, is the Disclaimer section, which precedes the Introduction:

>Many project websites link to this document in their sections on how to get help. That's fine, it's the use we intended — but if you are a webmaster creating such a link for your project page, please display prominently near the link notice that we are not a help desk for your project!
>
>We have learned the hard way that without such a notice, we will repeatedly be pestered by idiots who think having published this document makes it our job to solve all the world's technical problems.
>
>If you're reading this document because you need help, and you walk away with the impression you can get it directly from the authors of this document, you are one of the idiots we are talking about. Don't ask us questions. We'll just ignore you. We are here to show you how to get help from people who actually know about the software or hardware you're dealing with, but 99.9% of the time that will not be us. Unless you know for certain that one of the authors is an expert on what you're dealing with, leave us alone and everybody will be happier.

And to all the brave souls have risked being "pestered by idiots" by giving up their time to help their peers and the
next generation of hackers, ***Danke Sch&#246;n***!
