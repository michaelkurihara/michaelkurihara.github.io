## How Many Damn Languages Does It Take to Make A Website?!?!

It has almost been twenty years since I wrote my first HTML file.  I have made almost dozen half-hearted attempts to learn how to do some basic web development over the last two decades, and with every attempt I am struck the same conceited question:  How many damn languages does it to make a website?  Seriously?  How many does it take?

I wrote my first HTML file back in 1999, so I remember when it was just HTML and CSS.  Over time, this problem has seemingly gotten worse.  A few years ago, I learned about coding boot camps.  I looked up the Javascript developer curriculum for one such boot camp, and I was dumbfounded by the promise to cover "[20+ languages and frameworks](https://www.devleague.com/tracks/view/javascript-web-engineer)."  That seemed both insane and unreal - and I am not referring to the idea of cover all that in 16 weeks.  How could there be 20+ languages and frameworks to learn???  I remember looking up some those languages and framework.  I merely r flipped out over the idea that CSS was not enough and somebodies invented SASS and Less.  I lost my lunch when started to learn more about the Javascript situation!  

Now that I have declared the CS major and I am thinking about going into digital humanities, I think have gained some perspective, and it is one of the reasons I am so excited by the promise of Semantic UI.  But first a brief trip back into history.

## The limits of HTML alone

In 1999, just scant 3 years after the release of CSS, I wrote wrote some HTML for a lecture I was giving on the rise of Islam for History 151: World Civilizations.  I wanted Outline, and HTML seem perfect.  I could make an outline with hyperlinks to images and have all of it projected onto the big screen!  Needless to say, I did not use any CSS.  I wrote all my "styling" in-line.  I did not see the point to using any CSS.  This decision less based on arrogance, and more based in ignorance.  Not mention a ton of laziness.  I am proud to say that I changed the background color!  Thankfully, I never posted my first masterpiece to the www, so there is no evidence of my first best effort. I can say with no ego that as god awful as it seems now, my endeavor was exactly what I wanted.  Like most historians, I like outlines for lecture.  What really matters to us is the narrative we weave with some images thrown into add some color.  By today's standard this does not sound very innovative, but please keep in mind that back in 1999, most of the UHM history faculty were still paring transparencies with an overhead projector!  This was the bleeding edge.

I stole the idea of making a html outline from Prof Karen Jolly, one of the more tech savvy members of the UHM History Department.  Here is a link to one her lecture outlines from the HIST 151 that she taught in 2008: [Christian Culture In Byzantium.](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~kjolly/151f08/081021Byz.html)  I will be the first to concede that this web site now feels as old as its subject matter.  I am big believe in the importance of negative space, but this web site seems also haunted by all its emptiness.  Knowing how Prof Jolly lectures, there is more than enough substance for her to fill in gaps in content.  The void that this web site cannot fill is that at best it does not capture the eye, at worst it offends it.

In contrast, there is the [National Archives DOCSTeach website}(https://www.docsteach.org/), which is very modern, i.e., stylized.  When I first learned about digital humanities, I realized that part of the problem is that historian cannot just rely on narrative alone.  Would be digital historians need to learn to not only communicate visually, we need to know how to use the tools of the visual medium.  Knowing HTML is not enough anymore.  Back in 1999, I was truly happy with just using html and writing all my styling into the html tags.
