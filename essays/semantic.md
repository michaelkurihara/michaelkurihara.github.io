## How Many Damn Languages Does It Take to Make A Website


I wrote my fist set html files back in 1999.  Just a scant 3 years after the initial release of CSS.  Needless to say, I did not use any CSS.  I wrote all my "styling" in-line.  I did not see the point to using any CSS.  The end result was an outline with hyplinks to some image files.  I am proud to say that I changed the background color.  Thankfully, I never posted my first masterpiece to the www, so there is no longer any evidence of my first best effort. I can say with no ego that as god awful as it seems now, my endeavor was exactly what I wanted.  And still way better than PowerPoint to boot!  You see, I was giving a guest lecture on the rise of Islam for History 151: World Civilizations.  I wanted an outline.  Like most historians, I like outlines, because what really matters is the narrative of our lecture peppered with some images.  By today's standard this does not sound very innovative, but eep in mind that back in 1999, most of the UHM history faculty were still using transparencies and an overhead projector!  This was the bleeding edge.

I stole the idea of making a html outline from Prof Karen Jolly, one of the more tech savvy members of the UHM History Department.  Here is a link to one her lecture outlines from the HIST 151 that she taught in 2008: [Christian Culture In Byzantium.](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~kjolly/151f08/081021Byz.html)  I will be the first to concede that this web site now feels as old as its subject matter.  I am big believe in the importance of negative space, but this web site seems also haunted by all its emptiness.  Knowing how Prof Jolly lectures, there is more than enough substance for her to fill in gaps in content.  The void that this web site cannot fill is that at best it does not capture the eye, at worst it offends it.

As so we come to the point.  Would be digital historians need to learn to not only communicate visually, we need to know how to use the tools of the digital medium.  Knowing html is not enough anymore.  Back in 1999, I was truly happy with just using html and writing all my styling into the html tags.  I believe Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin put it best when he said, "how many damn languages do you have to know to make a web site"
