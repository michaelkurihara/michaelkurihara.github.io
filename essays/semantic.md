## I See What You Mean...sort of


I wrote my fist set html files back in 1999.  Just 3 years after the release of CSS.  Needless to say, I did not use any CSS.  I barely I wrote all my styling in-line.  The end result was basically an outline with hyplinks to some image files.  I do not think I even bothered to change the background color.  Thankfully, I never posted my first masterpiece to the www. I can say with no ego that as god awful as it seems now, they were exactly what I wanted.  And still way better than PowerPoint to boot!  You see, I was giving a guest lecture on the rise of Islam for History 151: World Civilizations, and I wanted an outline that made it easy to also show images.  By today's this does not sound very innovative, but you have to keep in mind many of the UHM history faculty were still using transparencies and an overhead projector!  This was the bleeding edge, at least in the field of history. 
 
I stole the idea of making a html outline from Prof Karen Jolly.  Here is a link to one her lecture outline from the HIST 151 she taught in 2008: [Christian Culture In Byzantium.](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~kjolly/151f08/081021Byz.html)  I will be the first to concede that this web site now feels as old as its subject matter.  



As I not have bear the burden of hosting such a pathetic set of html files because I never posted it to the inter-web.  I had made them for a guest lecture for History 151:  World Civilizations.  

Now as pathetic as the those web pages were, I liked them because I did not like PowerPoint.  I liked using outlines and I found it convenient 


I was a teaching assistant for History 151: World Civilization I.  I was giving the lecture on the rise of Islam.  A topic I was really excited about.  I did not want to use PowerPoint, so decided that I should learn to make a simple web page.  And by simple, I really mean a fancy outline with hyperlinks to images files and other web pages.  Pretty pathetic, but
