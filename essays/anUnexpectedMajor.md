>When it comes to math, there are three kinds of people.
>Those who can do math.
>And those you cannot.


When I signed up for ICS 111, I did it mostly out of boredom.  Thankfully, as an employee of the university, I can take classes.  Most of the classes I have were out of personal interests like German, Japanese, and music.  By taking an ICS class, I hoped that I might learn “something” to  make my job a little easier, but majoring in computer science was not even thought.   


On the very first day, the professor announced that there was going to be a math test the following week, and I immediately thought about dropping out right then and there.  For nearly all my life, I believed that there are “math people” and then there is the rest of us.  This self-imposed mental block eventually evolved into a minor case of math phobia, so much so that after high school I did everything I could to avoid math.  So, the thought of taking a math test with more than decade between me and my last math class sounded like a sure fire way to embarrass myself.  


Thankfully, I curbed that impulse, and as the professor continued his introduction, he told us that the secret to passing his course was to “code every day.”  I knew I could do that, so I signed up Khan Academy and the study some remedial math over weekend.  While I didn’t ace the math test, I did not fail.  Over the course of semester, I had a friend tutor me, and slowly but surely began to conqueror my math phobia.  The more code I wrote, the easier it was for me to think about coding and math as matter of practice.  

By the end of the semester, I realized that I wanted to major in computer science because:
1.  I found myself confront my fear of math
2.  I loved writing code
3.  I learned about digital humanities!
