summary: My team won the Spring 2015 ICS 111 Chicken Herder Contest

My final ICS 111 project was to create an AI to control 5 drones programmed to herd 10 chickens back to
their coop.  This was a group project with teams competing against each other to see whose drones could herd the chickens the quickest.  I proud to say that my team won the challenge!

My team came together by choice as opposed to being assigned to a team.  My two teammates were Ed White and Jesus Gonzalez.  None of us had worked together before, but we were all impressed by each other’s previous projects. 

What I remember most about this project was that it was team effort in the sense everyone contributed.  Unlike the previous group projects, everyone made important contributions to the code.  My only regret was that we did not know how to use Git or any other version control system.  We used Jesus’ Google Drive to share code, and this had a curious effect on how our code evolved.  Instead of actively discussing the our code, we simply kept posting different versions of our code.  Each of us would then take the best parts of each others code and then submit a new version until we were all satisfied.  We did not break up the project in to discrete parts.  We basically operated like individuals who shared our code with each other.  One the things I hope to get out of the class is how to truly work like a time.
