My job at the UHM School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene Office of Student Services requires me to deal with a lot of csv files.  When I took ICS 111, I hoped that I would learn how to deal with them better.  For years I massaged the data into a more malleable format so that I could append the data into my Microsoft Access database.  Thankfully, we learned about parsing, but not how to deal with file systems in Windows.  Eventually, I figured out away to write a Java program to do almost everything I wanted, but not entirely.  Then I took Introduction to Scripting and learned about Regular Expressions.   and Perl and like xkcd

Learning REGEX and Perl has made it possible to do almost everything I could have wanted.
